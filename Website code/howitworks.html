								<li><h3 style="text-align: center;">Commuter-friendly</h3><p>Transportation is fully in the hands of the commuter. Customers interact with the NEO blockchain and only the NEO blockchain, to buy tickets. They are also incentivised (through a 50% refund) to mark their trip as "complete" when they disembark, providing live marketing data with small error margins to the Transit Organization.<br><b style="color: #121841;">As we respect the Right to Privacy of a European citizen, at no point does our commuter yield his private details</b>, as it is not required - the system does not rely on trust.</p></li>
								<li><h3 style="text-align: center;">Transit-Organization-friendly</h3><p>Efficient ticketing without printing and logistical costs, along with live Marketing data about your transit lines (such as current Active tickets, popularity) without monitoring your passengers. Instead, your passengers provide the information themselves, with respect to their own rights. <b style="color: #121841;">Additionally, the whole infastracture is decentralized</b>, which means away from your own hands and not vulnerable to attacks and downtime.</p><i>(NOTE: Organizations are strongly encouraged to run a Node on the NEO Network, and give back to the community, which provides the Blockchain at no cost)</i></li>
								<li><h3 style="text-align: center;">Government-friendly</h3><p>The entire system is completely transparent and ready for auditing by any governing body, to ensure the Transit Organization's fair treatment of European public funds and ticket income. Dishonesty and falsehoods are, by design, unable to exist on the NEO Blockchain.</p></li>
							</ul>
							<h2>In general, SmartTransit is a unified ticketing and logistics system built to appeal to everyone, that belongs to everyone.</h2>
							<p>We made it our "mantra" to yield no advantage from traditional systems, and build a well-running, Blockchain-based solution which is <i>fully dominant</i> (better or at least as good in all aspects) of traditional electronic ticketing systems.</p>
